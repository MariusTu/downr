description: Build an ML pipeline with data transforms and algorithms to train an ML model.
phase: 3
step: 1
---

In this section, you'll configure a data processing pipeline to use to prepare the data, the algorithm to use, and you'll create a machine learning model to predict used car prices.

If you were not able to complete the last section, use this version of the code as the [starting point](https://github.com/luisquintanilla/mlnet-workshop-guide/archive/2-1.zip).
