.NET Core 3.0 introduced the idea of the Worker template. The Worker template, or "Worker Service," bootstraps your project with a pre-wired [BackgroundService](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/hosted-services?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio#backgroundservice-base-class) class. `BackgroundService` classes provide an implementation for the `IHostedService` interface, and are great for scenarios like `web-queue-worker` or when you need background processing that "runs forever."

Create a Worker project with the following `dotnet new` command:

```bash
dotnet new worker -o WorkerService
cd WorkerService
code .
```

Visual Studio Code should open to the folder in which the new `WorkerService` project was created. If asked, click **Yes** when Visual Studio Code asks if you'd like to add required assets to the project.

Open up the *Worker.cs* file. Inside it, you'll see the `ExecuteAsync` method. This method will run continuously until the Worker process exits or the `StopAsync` method is called.

```csharp
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
    while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Worker running at: {time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
        await Task.Delay(1000, stoppingToken);
    }
}
```

Increase the amount of time the `ExecuteAsync` method pauses in between executions, or change the message being displayed.

```csharp
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
    while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Hello from the WorkerService at: {time}", DateTimeOffset.Now);
        await Task.Delay(3000, stoppingToken);
    }
}
```

Once you're satisfied with the change you've made, press <kbd>F5</kbd> or debug the Worker. It will run in the console or terminal window and simply write to the standard output as the `ExecuteAsync` method fires.
