description: Before we create the NGINX controller in the AKS cluster, we'll need to set up a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that will resolve to the cluster's public IP address.
phase: 4
step: 2
---

In this step, you'll use the Azure CLI in some advanced scenarios to manipulate the public IP address of the AKS cluster. The goal of this step is to associate a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) with a new public IP address.

Get the resource group where the network resources are located that support your AKS cluster:

```bash
az aks show --resource-group dotnetworkshops --name dotnetworkshop --query nodeResourceGroup -o tsv
```

The CLI will return the name of the resource group in which the AKS cluster's network resources are stored. When it does, copy the resource group name to your clipboard.

![AKS cluster network resource group name](media/get-aks-resource-group.png)

Open the Azure portal and paste in the name of the resource group into the search box. Then click the resource group you find to open the resource group portal blade in the browser.

Execute this Azure CLI script, replacing the string `<resource-group>` with the name of the resource group you copied.

```bash
az network public-ip create --resource-group <resource-group> --name akspublicip --sku Standard --allocation-method static --query publicIp.ipAddress -o tsv
```

The result of the call will be displayed in the terminal window, but filtered to only show the public IP address that was just created. Copy this to your clipboard.

Go back to the Azure portal blade for the resource group containing the AKS cluster's network resources. Find the **Public IP address** resource you just created in the resource group (you may need to refresh).

![Public IP address](media/find-the-public-ip.png)

Note how the DNS name for the IP address is blank.

![No DNS name](media/no-dns-name.png)

Use the name of the public IP address resource and the name of the resource group in which it's housed (the resource group name you copied earlier) to execute an Azure CLI script that will provide the resource ID of the public IP address resource.

```bash
az resource show --query id --resource-type Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses -n akspublicip -g MC_DotNetWorkshops_dotnetworkshop_eastus
```

When the CLI command executes, copy the resource ID string it prints to the terminal window.

For the HTTPS certificates to work correctly, configure a FQDN for the ingress controller IP address. Update the following script with the IP address of your ingress controller and a unique name that you would like to use for the FQDN. Use the ID of the public ip address resource you copied earlier.

> **Note**: You should probably **not** use the string *workshop*, but rather use your alias or something you know will be unique. The DNS will be used as the prefix in a string such as `workshop.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`, so if the prefix you've chosen has already been used, it might not work. So, use something unique.

```bash
az network public-ip update --ids {resource-id-string-you-copied} --dns-name bradyg-cloudnative
```

After a few moments, you should see the public IP address resource updated with the FQDN of the AKS cluster's ingress.

Copy the public IP address from the portal.

In the next step, you'll use Helm and the Kubernetes command line (`kubectl`) to create a public NGINX ingress and enable external access to the AKS cluster.
