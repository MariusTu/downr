## What is ONNX?

The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open source format for AI models. ONNX supports interoperability between frameworks. This means you can train a model in one of the many popular machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, convert it into ONNX format and consume the ONNX model in a different framework like ML.NET. To learn more, visit the [ONNX website](https://onnx.ai/).

## What is Azure Custom Vision?

Azure Custom Vision is a cloud-based service that lets you build, deploy, and export custom deep learning computer vision models. Visit the [Azure Custom Vision](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/home) documentation to learn more.
