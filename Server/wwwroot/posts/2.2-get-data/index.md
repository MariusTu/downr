Normally, you would need to download the data and, if necessary, extract or unzip it to a directory on your computer. For this lab, you already have the data in the `data` directory in this repository in a file called `true_car_listings.csv`.

You can open and inspect the CSV file's contents using a tool like Excel:

Note the column names - we will use them in the next step.
