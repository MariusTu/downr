> Note: This is a work-in-progress and not completed yet

You'll need a Git client and a GitHub account to perform this step. Once you have that part set up, the ideal process to follow is as follows:

1. Go to the [downr](https://github.com/bradygaster/downr) repository
1. Fork the repository into your own organization or account
1. Clone from your fork, and create a branch off of master for each new workshop you want
1. Publish your content to a web server

Once you have your fork of the downr repository cloned to your development machine, go on to the next step.
